# Simple-explanation-of-what-logarithm-is
Logarithm is a way to accomplish something you have in mind. for that, you must follow steps, and through these steps that you are following in order to accomplish something, you will be performing a logarithm
a simple example would be you crossing the street. to cross a street, you have to wait for the pedestrian traffic lights to turn green (that was a step). you should also check if you have a car coming down the street (another step). With these two steps completed, you can cross the street
this was a simple example of a logarithm. in computing, it would go something like this: to create an application or program that does something, you have to go through several steps (in a program, you use commands). simple, isn't it?
